            <p>
                Full-stack developer with a fifteen year IT management career background. The decision to leave IT and pursue development was, not only, an easy one but a logical one. The years I spent honing in my prowess as a master troubleshooter makes this pivot into the problem-solving oriented world of development a no-brainer. All-the-while allowing me to explore the creative side of tech vs. the "Is it on or off?" rut of IT support.

                Here you will find the work that I have built and curated to showcase the skillset that I now have honed as a developer.

                Outside of tech, I am a rabid fan of all things music. Not only a fan but a player. I also enjoy riding and working on vintage motorcycles in my free time. When I get to drop out of the rat-race, there is nothing I love more than a good multi-week moto-camp trip. On or off-road. I'm not picky.
